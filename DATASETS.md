# Datasets

This file describes the basic parameters of the datasets appeared in the program. Note that before version 2.0.0, there is only 1 dataset used, i.e. `Human3.6M`. More datasets will be carried out after the implementation of the Inference part of this program.

## Human3.6M (Native Dataset)

### Vertex Layout

The layout of the vertices in the dataset `Human3.6M` is shown below. The left graph is the complete version of the dataset, and the right is the simplified version of the dataset, which is used in our program.
